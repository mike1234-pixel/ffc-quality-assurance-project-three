## User Stories

- Users can add new books, and add new comments to books using the book id returned.

- Users can see all books in the library on the route `/api/books/`

- Users can see data for a specific book on the route `/api/books/{bookid}`

- Users can delete either one book or all books using the delete buttons. 

## Packages 

This API is written in *Node.js* and uses *express*, *helmet.js*, *mongoose* and *mongodb*. *jQuery* and *Material Design Bootstrap* are used on the frontend. *Mocha* and *Chai* are used as dev dependencies to run the functional tests. To run the tests simply run `npm run dev` in the terminal.
